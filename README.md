## ✨ Why I Built Gemu

As a passionate B.Tech CSE student and frontend developer, I created Gemu.co.io to combine three things I love:

1. **Coding** – building things from scratch using vanilla JavaScript.
2. **Gaming** – simple but fun browser-based games.
3. **Learning** – improving design, UI/UX, and interactivity with each game.

It’s not just a playground for games — it’s a **showcase of growth** as a web developer.
